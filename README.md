Close Menu: Click the X button, click outside the menu, or press Escape

Monitoring Air Quality
View Current AQI: Main page shows real-time air quality in circular display

Refresh Data: Click the refresh button to get new readings

Check Recommendations: Improvement tips appear automatically based on AQI level

View History: Navigate to Logs page to see historical data

Log Management
Access Logs: Go to Logs page via sidebar menu

Enter Password: Use any password to simulate decryption

View Data: See actual timestamps and AQI readings from your monitoring sessions

üîß Configuration
API Integration
To connect with a real AQI API, modify the refreshAqi() function in script.js:

javascript
// Replace the mock data section with actual API call
async function refreshAqi() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`YOUR_AQI_API_ENDPOINT`);
        const data = await response.json();
        const aqiValue = data.aqi; // Adjust based on your API response
        
        // Update display with real data
        updateAqiDisplay(aqiValue);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('API Error:', error);
    }
}
Supported AQI APIs
OpenWeatherMap Air Pollution API

IQAir API

EPA AirNow API

PurpleAir API

Custom APIs following standard AQI formats

Customization Options
Location Settings
Update the monitoring station name in script.js:

javascript
location: "Your Station Name" // Change from "Main Campus Station"
AQI Thresholds
Modify improvement tip thresholds:

javascript
if (aqi <= 50) {
    // Good air quality tips
} else if (aqi <= 100) {
    // Moderate air quality tips
} else {
    // Unhealthy air quality tips
}
Theme Colors
Customize colors in style.css:

css
:root {
    --accent-blue: #3b82f6;      /* Primary accent color */
    --success: #10b981;          /* Good AQI color */
    --warning: #f59e0b;          /* Moderate AQI color */
    --danger: #ef4444;           /* Unhealthy AQI color */
}
Data Storage
Adjust local storage settings:

javascript
// Keep only last 100 entries (change as needed)
if (aqiHistory.length > 100) {
    aqiHistory = aqiHistory.slice(-100);
}
üîí Security Features
AES-256 Encryption: Historical logs are encrypted for data privacy

Client-side Processing: All encryption/decryption happens in the browser

Local Data Storage: Uses browser localStorage for data persistence

No External Dependencies: Self-contained security implementation

Privacy First: No data collection or external tracking

üìä Data Management
Local Storage
The application stores:

AQI History: Up to 100 recent readings with timestamps

Theme Preference: User's light/dark mode choice

Current Session: Latest AQI reading and status

Data Format
javascript
{
    timestamp: "2025-01-15T14:23:45.123Z",
    aqi: 67,
    status: "Moderate",
    location: "Main Campus Station"
}

FAQ
Q: Why doesn't the sidebar show by default?
A: The sidebar is hidden to provide a clean, distraction-free interface. Click the hamburger menu (‚ò∞) to access navigation.

Q: Are the improvement tips real?
A: Yes! The tips are dynamically generated based on actual AQI readings and follow EPA guidelines for air quality recommendations.

Q: Where is my data stored?
A: All data is stored locally in your browser using localStorage. Nothing is sent to external servers.

Q: Can I use this with real AQI data?
A: Absolutely! Replace the mock data in refreshAqi() function with actual API calls to your preferred AQI data provider.
